# Welding Extraction and Alignment

This step involves identifying welding seams and aligning them for analysis.

### Process:
1. **Edge Detection**: Using Sobel filters to locate weld boundaries.
2. **Alignment Algorithms**: Adjusting the detected welds to a standard reference.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Gathering welding characteristics for further processing.

Accurate alignment is essential for effective machine learning analysis.
